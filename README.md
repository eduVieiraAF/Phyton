- Why not add Python?

## This time I'm using VS Code intead of Intellij so that I can get used to another IDE.

This repository is a like a notebook so that I can learn a little bit of Python and maybe who knows one day get to work with it. My actual goal is to work with Java/Kotlin and develop apps, though.
